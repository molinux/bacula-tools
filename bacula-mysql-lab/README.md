# Project Title

Bacula MySQL Lab

## Getting Started

~~Sometimes, I had to do some intervention on Bacula, but some backups were running.~~
~~I needed to cancel all backups, perform maintenance, and soon after, see which backups would have to run again.~~

~~bacula-outage helps you with this work, automating the entire process.~~

### Prerequisites

~~You need to have the Bacula environment up and running~~

### Installing

#### Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install mysql-server
```
